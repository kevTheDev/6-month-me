  Every Six Months is a free to use service developed by kev_the_dev. Inspired by an activity I did at the end of the Cambridge run Enterprisers, and further inspired by FutureMe.org I decided to the create an app that would provide for my needs and mine alone.

  Feedback is welcome via the GetSatisfaction widget, but I promise you that I won't be implementing an alternative registration/login process. I want to keep this app as minimalist as possible, and by using OpenID only I am keeping to this principle.
