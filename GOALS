Improvements to FutureMe:

With OpenId you should not have to log in - you supply your openID email and let OpenId do all the verification.

you do not supply a date - it is just 6 months from now.

No public or private - just private.

you can view past emails but only after they have been sent - no editing or any rubbish like that.
