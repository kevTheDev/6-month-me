Improvements to FutureMe:

With OpenId you should not have to log in - you supply your openID email and let OpenId do all the verification.

you do not supply a date - it is just 6 months from now.

No public or private - just private.

you can view past emails but only after they have been sent - no editing or any rubbish like that.


Next logical steps

sort out email formatting

rake task to send emails
twice daily cron job run rake task

fix and add new specs

allow the user to create the email before signing in

register on the open id app directory
register on the appjack

cool icons

what problem does 6 month reminder solve?
icons to describe user flow and problem solved
