Improvements to FutureMe:

With OpenId you should not have to log in - you supply your openID email and let OpenId do all the verification.

you do not supply a date - it is just 6 months from now.

No public or private - just private.

you can view past emails but only after they have been sent - no editing or any rubbish like that.


Next logical steps


work out the date six months from now - and set on email field

cron job to send emails




allow the user to create the email before signing in

fix and add new specs

deploy to server

register on the open id app directory
register on the appjack

cool icons
