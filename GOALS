Improvements to FutureMe:

With OpenId you should not have to log in - you supply your openID email and let OpenId do all the verification.

you do not supply a date - it is just 6 months from now.

No public or private - just private.

you can view past emails but only after they have been sent - no editing or any rubbish like that.


Next logical steps

write some kind of before filter - apply to all relevant actions so we make sure that the user is logged in

error handling on open id submission

work out the date six months from now

cron job to send emails


allow the user to create the email before signing in

replace activerecord with datamapper or sequel?



Session probs with OpenID:

We pass a session hash to the OpenID Consumer instance
we later on set a current_user value as a symbol key

maybe the session hash should be set using strings
