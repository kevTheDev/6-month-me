Improvements to FutureMe:

With OpenId you should not have to log in - you supply your openID email and let OpenId do all the verification.
you do not supply a date - it is just 6 months from now.
No public or private - just private.

You can view emails that you have sent (No edit or delete)
You can view, edit and cancel reminders that have not yet been sent

Next logical steps
