Improvements to FutureMe:

With OpenId you should not have to log in - you supply your openID email and let OpenId do all the verification.

you do not supply a date - it is just 6 months from now.

No public or private - just private.

you can view past emails but only after they have been sent - no editing or any rubbish like that.


Next logical steps

email index action
email view action

before_filter on email index and show, and create

stylesheet would be nice
get the openid icon


error handling on open id submission

work out the date six months from now

cron job to send emails




allow the user to create the email before signing in

fix and add new specs

deploy to server

register on the open id app directory
register on the appjack
