Improvements to FutureMe:

With OpenId you should not have to log in - you supply your openID email and let OpenId do all the verification.

you do not supply a date - it is just 6 months from now.

No public or private - just private.

you can view past emails but only after they have been sent - no editing or any rubbish like that.


Next logical steps

store info in user model so that we can sign in again - hacky version - store user id in session, and do user find each time requested
after open id log in - make user currently logged in user
write some kind of before filter - apply to all relevant actions so we make sure that the user is logged in

associate email with user

send an email to the user - it is a copy of the email that they will be sent in six months, and also serves as a preliminary test to show them that the system works - get user confidence

send email to user


work out the date six months from now



allow the user to create the email before signing in

replace activerecord with datamapper or sequel?
