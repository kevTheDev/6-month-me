Improvements to FutureMe:

With OpenId you should not have to log in - you supply your openID email and let OpenId do all the verification.
you do not supply a date - it is just 6 months from now.
No public or private - just private.

You can view emails that you have sent (No edit or delete)
You can view, edit and cancel reminders that have not yet been sent

Next logical steps

register a shell company for my personal projects

http basic auth
sort out email formatting

rake task to send emails
twice daily cron job run rake task

fix and add new specs

allow the user to create the email before signing in

register on the open id app directory
register on the appjack

cool icons

what problem does 6 month reminder solve?
icons to describe user flow and problem solved


Time::DATE_FORMATS[:tourdust_date] = "%d, %b, %y, %I:%M%p"
Time::DATE_FORMATS[:statement_date] = "%d-%m-%y"

GOTCHA:

If there is a column missing from the model at the db level, get error like: "unknown method for #"
