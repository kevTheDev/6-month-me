Improvements to FutureMe:

With OpenId you should not have to log in - you supply your openID email and let OpenId do all the verification.
you do not supply a date - it is just 6 months from now.
No public or private - just private.

You can view emails that you have sent (No edit or delete)
You can view, edit and cancel reminders that have not yet been sent

Next logical steps

JS to switch between openid and regular auth on register page
copy on home page

sort out email formatting
call to action on receipt of email
google analytics

post to steve pavlina forums
post to hacker news forums


hide whois information - apparently this cannot be done???

js confirm on cancel reminder
style links as buttons on email index
styling for flash messages

site map

proper terms and conditions
better contact page
register shell company

allow the user to create the email before signing in

logo/icons

register on the github list of apps that use sinatra
register on the open id app directory
register on the appjack

what problem does 6 month reminder solve?
icons to describe user flow and problem solved

Sinatra / ActiveRecord GOTCHA:

If there is a column missing from the model at the db level, get error like: "unknown method for #"
